**Submit a brief summary of your experience with Git, including the merge conflict you encountered and how you resolved it.**
Most of the time i used TortoiseGit for my work as it's providing GUI for most of git operation instead of using git bash command. There was a bit challenge for me to familiar with those commands at first, but it's a good knowledge to understand the concepts of git operation especially when i tried to solve the branches conflict which required me to check on file contents and analysed the issue.
